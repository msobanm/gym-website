# Ecommerce Site (In development) Gym Products

Literally the gym version with different design as of e-com site.

An e-commerce site I am developing to include in my portfolio. Designed it myself, got inspiration from different sites including Cross stitch.

Currently I'm using a free api called Fake Store Api to get my products. The Home page is hard coded for design purposes, they are on Products page. Have used React query for storing them instead of Redux as it will be excessive.
